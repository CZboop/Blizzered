A big thank you to Aezur on OpenGameArt.org for the running animation, and Q_x on OpenGameArt.org for the stew art.

## Original Version
This was one of my first coding projects, and for sentimental reasons I wanted to both preserve the original and also improve the code!

The original 2021 version of this project is preserved at [v0-original](https://github.com/CZboop/Blizzered/releases/tag/v0-original).
